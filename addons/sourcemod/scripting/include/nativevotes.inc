MenuAction_Select		An item was selected (param1=client, param2=item). For subplugin support; normal plugins
						should use NativeVotes_SetResultCallback or catch the MenuAction_VoteEnd action.
MenuAction_End			A vote has fully ended and the vote object is ready to be cleaned up
						param1 is MenuEnd reason, either MenuEnd_VotingCancelled or MenuEnd_VotingDone
MenuAction_VoteEnd		A vote sequence has succeeded (param1=chosen item)
						This is not called if NativeVotes_SetResultCallback has been used on the vote.
						You should call NativeVotes_DisplayPass or NativeVotes_DisplayPassEx after this
MenuAction_VoteStart	A vote sequence has started (nothing passed).  Use this instead of MenuAction_Start
MenuAction_VoteCancel	A vote sequence has been cancelled (param1=reason)
MenuAction_DisplayItem	Item text is being drawn to the display (param1=client, param2=item)
						To change the text, use NativeVotes_RedrawVoteItem().
